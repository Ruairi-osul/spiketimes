tests: 
    - finish writing tests for existing functions

 new features:
    - binned firing rate 
        - given an array of spiking events, creates a

    - isi 
        - given an array of spike times, give the inter spike intervals
    
    - ifr 
        - zeros in given bin width 
        - bin the spikes where it was x 
        - convolve with some kernel

    - binned spike train 
        - X 
    
    - cross corralogram 
        - X 
    
    - coherance of spike trains 
        - X 
    
    - fft of spike train 
        - X
